        <section id="main-bio">
            <p>I have lived in Gilbert, Arizona for the past 12 years, but have been working in Tempe as a professional educator. I earned a bachelors degree in Earth Science and Secondary Education from Northern Arizona University in the beautiful Flagstaff, Arizona. Putting my degree to good use, I have spent over a decade teaching indroductory science concepts to eighth grade students in the Tempe elementary school district #3. Some of the concepts I was responsible for teaching include the foundations of chemistry, genetics, and physics.</p>
            <p>I have recently decided to seek new adventures and challenges in the world of information technology. More specifically, I would like to gain skills in web and application development. In order to reach these goals, I have recently been accepted to and am currently attending a coding bootcamp sponsored by the University of Arizona. I am excited to reach my new goals and pursue my new exciting career in web development. </p>
